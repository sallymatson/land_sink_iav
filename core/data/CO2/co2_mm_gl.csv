# The uncertainty in the global monthly mean is estimated using a,,,
# a monte carlo technique that computes 100 globally-averaged time,,,
# series, each time using a slightly different set of measurement,,
# records from the NOAA ESRL cooperative air sampling network.  The,,,
# reported uncertainty, 0.13 ppm, is the mean of the standard deviations,
# for each monthly mean using this technique.  Please see Conway et al.,,,
# 1994, JGR, vol. 99, no. D11. for a complete discussion.  Units are ppm.
#,,,
# CO2 expressed as a mole fraction in dry air, micromol/mol, abbreviated as ppm,
#,,,
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality,,
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same,,
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.,,,
